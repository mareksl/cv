## Summary

After studying Applied Linguistics, I decided to broaden my education and pursue a career in IT, starting with Front-End and Javascript Development. I have worked hard in my own time to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript using various resources such as online courses, books and tutorials, actively following and seeking support from experienced developers and practising programming by completing projects. I am always actively learning and expanding my knowledge, attending meetups and following current trends in both Front-End and Back-End Javascript Development.

I have experience working in the Scrum framework with international Agile teams of developers, designers and testers and am always eager to contribute to a project and be part of it.
